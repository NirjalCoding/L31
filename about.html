        <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-right: auto;">Hi Myself Nirjal I am very hardworking person and I
            believe that if u help others you cqn learn form it yourself! I am good at fast-paced, practical problems in any extraordinary active mind with
            good problem solving skills and an appetite to learn new things.
            <br><br>
            I take so much pleasure in producing good work, being able to mesh with others and see how I can improve myself professionally as a person. My best asset is that when I am involved however much time I put into something. <br><br> Do I need
            places in which grow, learn from others and utilize my capabilities to meet with organizational goals?</p>
